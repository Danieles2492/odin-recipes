    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>“The most famous sauce in the world—"Bolognese" or
        "Ragù alla bolognese"— is a meat- and tomato-based sauce that originates from Bologna in northern Italy. If you ask about spaghetti bolognese in the region, you will always get the same answer: 
        "Gli spaghetti bolognese non esistono" ("There is no such thing as spaghetti bolognese") since the sauce is served with thicker pasta that it can better cling to!
